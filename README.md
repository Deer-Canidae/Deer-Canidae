# Hi! I'm Deer 🦌

***Looking for a summer internship***

## Who's Deer ⁉️

I'm a computer engineering student. I'm always trying to learn more about any kind of tech.
I like to get to know a wide variety of tools, languages, platforms and problems to solve.
Though I mostly post web projects, I've also worked with TypeScript, Rust, C, C++, Bash among others.
I live in the terminal (neovim + tmux ❤️).

## Projects 🚧

- [Logic Bob](https://logicbob.pages.dev/): A logic gate simulator to help get an intuitive understanding of logic circuits
- [Precision Clock](https://precision-clock.pages.dev/): A clock with millisecond precision, made as  an exercise to practice animation frames and adaptive PWAs (mobile / desktop)
